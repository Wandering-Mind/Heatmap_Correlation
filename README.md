Healthcare Data Science Project: Predicting Disease Risk Based on Patient Data
Project Overview 

Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension can often be predicted using patient lifestyle and medical history. 
This project focuses on developing a predictive model that assesses a patientâ€™s risk for developing a specific disease.

Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in health data.
Train a classification model to predict disease risk.
Evaluate model performance and visualize key findings.
